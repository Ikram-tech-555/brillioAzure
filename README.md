# Azure Infrastructure Setup: Key Services and Architecture

Welcome to the **Azure Infrastructure** repo! This repository contains a structured guide to setting up and managing several essential Azure services, providing you with the flexibility and scalability to build and deploy cloud-native applications.

## 1. Azure App Configuration

Azure App Configuration is a fully managed service that helps developers centralize and manage application settings, feature flags, and key-value pairs across environments.

### Key Features:
- Centralized configuration management.
- Real-time updates for feature flags.
- Seamless integration with Azure services like Functions, Kubernetes, and more.

## 2. Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps provides a serverless environment for running microservices and containerized applications, making it easier to deploy applications with dynamic scaling and observability.

### Key Features:
- Built-in scaling based on HTTP traffic, events, or CPU usage.
- Simple deployment for microservices, APIs, and background tasks.
- Integrated with Dapr for distributed application development.

## 3. Azure Dev Center

Azure Dev Center provides a centralized portal for managing development environments, speeding up developer onboarding, and improving collaboration.

### Key Features:
- Automated environment provisioning.
- Role-based access control for team collaboration.
- Integrates seamlessly with Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions.

## 4. Azure Function App

Azure Functions allows you to run small pieces of code or "functions" without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, perfect for building event-driven microservices and real-time data processing.

### Key Features:
- Serverless compute with auto-scaling.
- Supports multiple programming languages.
- Event-driven execution triggered by HTTP, queues, timers, and more.

ðŸ“– **Documentation**: [Azure Function App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/)

## 5. Hub and Spoke Architecture

The **Hub and Spoke** architecture is an industry-standard design pattern for networking in the cloud, centralizing shared services in a "Hub" and connecting different environments ("Spokes") through controlled network paths.

### Key Features:
- Centralized management of network security.
- Simplified governance and policy enforcement.
- Cost-effective by reducing redundant network resources.
